## 👨‍💻 About Me  

Hello! I'm **Shwetabh Biswas**, currently working as an **AI Research Engineer** at **AAV Innovation Labs & Johnson & Johnson**.  

Here are some key highlights from my work and journey:

- **AI Engineer @ J&J & AAV Labs** → Building AI systems like:
  - 📈 *Innovation Graph*: GraphRAG-powered collaborative ideation platform  
  - 🏭 *Resource Allocation*: Forecasting model with SHAP & LIME interpretability for workforce optimization  
  - 📑 *Document Scoring System*: Automated design document evaluator using **Docling**  

- **Researcher @ IISc Bangalore (2024–25)**  
  - Published at **WACV 2025** (*FRAUD-Net* – 91.4% SOTA multimodal misinformation detection)  
  - Built **agentic AI pipelines** with **LangGraph** (10× faster inference using KV caching)  
  - Developed **deepfake detection models** & worked on **Google Project Vaani** for speech recognition  

- **Intern @ KissanAI** → Fine-tuned **Qwen-7B** for agriculture-based VQA, improving performance by **2×**, with public release on Hugging Face  

- **Early Projects** → Built gallery agent, VAE image reconstruction pipelines, and person-detection systems integrating **YOLO + FaceNet**  

I bring together **academic rigor** and **industry-scale engineering** to design AI that is practical, explainable, and impactful.
